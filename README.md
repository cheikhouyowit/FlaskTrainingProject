##Branch: templates

Summary: This branch covers the use of Jinja2 templates in Flask, which allows you to dynamically generate HTML on the server side. Template inheritance helps reduce redundancy, as you can create a base template that other templates extend.

Key Concepts:

    Creating and rendering templates using Flask's render_template function.
    Template inheritance to reuse common HTML structures.
    Passing variables from Flask views to templates.
    
    * Bootstrap layout
    * Block composition and layout inheritance
    * Creating a custom context processor
    * Creating a custom Jinja2 filter
    * Creating a custom macro for forms
    * Advanced date and time formatting
